<h2 class="q">
A. What is the basic information of the typhoon (This includes the wind speed, the amount of precipitation it brought, when and where it occurred, etc.)
<h2>

<p class="a">
The “Bagyong Yolanda” or also known as “Bagyong Haiyan” is a typhoon that happened on November 8 2013 and affected Micronesia, Palau, Philippines, South China and Vietnam. This kind of precipitation caused widespread destruction and loss of life. Its fury affected more than 14 million people across 44 provinces, claiming the lives of 8000 people. The Haiyans average wind speed was 230 km/h and its highest was 315 km/h.The typhoon itself has created a big impact due to it’s powerful winds and storm.The Haiyan formed on November 3 2013 in Micronesia and dissipated on November 11 2013 in Guangxi China. Typhoon Yolanda hit the Philippines way back in November 2013. The typhoon made the hardest hit on the region of leyte. Majority of the houses that were hit were damaged and completely destroyed, the typhoon also affected the source of income of many Filipinos because the typhoon destroyed their boats that they use for fishing.
</p>

<h2 class="q">
B. What is the basic information of the region that has been greatly affected by the typhoon (This includes the geographical location, economic status, population, etc.)? 
</h2>

<p class="a">
The Bagyong Yolanda or Bagyong Haiyan greatly affected the Visayas region in the Philippines. It is located in the central part of the Philippines and it consists of several islands. The Visayas region had a population of more than 18 million when the Haiyan hit. The storm damaged the economic life of many Filipinos, the typhoon caused billion of dollars in favor of the damages it inflicted to the agriculture, fisheries, farming, and any other sectors that has anything to do with economic. Leyte and Samar did not just get hit by the surge but some of their areas got affected for the reason that they were hit by the extreme winds. There are also some areas that got hit with winds though not severely impacted by them, these are Northern Cebu, Panay, and Coron. 
</p>

<h2 class="q">
C. How was the community affected by the typhoon?
</h2>

<p class="a">
The typhoons caused extensive damage due to their powerful winds, torrential rainfall, and storm surges, which resulted in severe flooding and landslides. Many cities and communities experienced widespread destruction, with some areas losing as much as 90% of housing. Thousands of people lost their lives and 4.1 million people were left displaced from their homes. Yolanda not only destroyed their houses but also ruined their livelihoods, which were primarily based on coconut farming, the Philippines' biggest source of income. The typhoon destroyed coconut farms all over the islands, leaving over a million coconut farmers without a means to support themselves as they had to wait years for their farms to recover. The typhoon also affected the local fisheries, which is one of the Philippines' most important sectors, employing many families who lost everything during Typhoon Yolanda and were left struggling once the storm was over.
</p>

<h2 class="q">
D. How did the community prepare for it? How did they recover?
</h2>

<p class="a">
An early warning has been issued by the authorities. The RDRRMC and NDRRMC chairperson had planned an action and alert for the regions IV-A, IV-B, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, Caraga, and even NCR. On November 5 2013 the Philippine Area Responsibility (PAR) and the NDRRMC council conducted a discussion regarding the typhoon preparations. For those who lived close to a huge body of water, a portion of the town or most of the residents has set up an evacuation center. Mostly in the provinces of Otom, Miag-ao, Iloilo city, tacloban, Tolosa, Gigaquit, Gingoog, Barbara, Catbalogan, and all of Eastern Samar had made preparations for their evacuation. Many Filipinos stand up together in resilience and rebuild their homes, a lot of residents are focused on rebuilding back their destroyed community. The government also planned a “Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery” program which focuses on livelihoods, social service, shelter, and infrastructure. They also organized a humanitarian aid program, this program helped people to immediate long-term reconstruction.
</p>

<h2 class="q">
E. How vulnerable are they to typhoons?
</h2>

<p class="a">
The destructive consequences of typhoons can be overwhelming, particularly for those residing in the impacted regions. These consequences can vary from physical damage to loss of human lives. The regions that encounter typhoons are confronted by numerous challenges and difficulties, such as damage to infrastructure, power outages, flooding, landslides, and disruption of transportation systems. The aftermath of these calamities can have far-reaching impacts that necessitate substantial resources and assistance for recovery. Vegetation cover and landform explain vulnerability better than the average slope in most instances. For different loss types the dominant socioeconomic vulnerability factor is different. For both typhoons, emergency transfer has a higher determining power ranking for the population vulnerability, while the percentage of the GDP made up of primary industry has higher ranking for the economic vulnerability. The dominant interaction effects between two vulnerability factors differ depending on the typhoon and loss type but show a nonlinear enhancement effect in most cases.
</p>

<h2 class="q">
F. Were there any damages? How severe they were?
</h2>

<p class="a">
Typhoon Yolanda, also known as Typhoon Haiyan, struck the Philippines in November 2013. It caused a lot of damage and affected many lives and communities. More than 4.1 million Filipinos got their houses destroyed which caused them to be displaced. Over 6,000 lives have been lost because of the severe damage typhoon Yolanda has caused. Some of the possible reasons are: starvation, drowning, and not being able to evacuate early or not being rescued, many Filipinos have lost their loved ones. Millions of Filipinos have completely lost their source of income. The typhoon has severely affected the farming and fishing life of Filipinos. The typhoon created a big impact in agriculture, it destroyed a lot of coconut trees and many farming landforms.  The typhoon was remarked as one of the strongest typhoons to hit the Philippines because it sustained winds exceeding 315 km/h at landfall. The typhoon had reached up to 24.6 feet high ( 7.5 meters ) which caused catastrophic flooding in a coastal area, specifically the city of Tacloban

<h2 class="q">
G. Was the typhoon accompanied by secondary disasters? How did they affect the community?
</h2>

<p class="a">
Yes, It affects short- and long-term mental health effects due to loss of family, property, livestock, or crops. The driving forces are pressures flooding and landslides that are of natural, social, economic, and ecological origins and interact in complex ways. It can also threaten lives, inundate properties and businesses, destroy belongings, damage vital infrastructure, etc.
</p>

<h2 class="q">
H. Were there any positive impacts of the typhoon in the region? What are those?
</h2>

<p class="a">
 While typhoons are typically associated with problems and harm to communities, there can be some beneficial outcomes in the aftermath. One such benefit is that these storms can aid in the replenishment of freshwater supplies by delivering much-needed rainfall to drought-stricken regions, can deposit nutrient-rich sediment onto agricultural lands, increase soil fertility and crop yields for future purposes, and can also play a crucial role in shaping and reshaping coastlines, which may ultimately benefit various ecosystems. And most importantly, experiencing the effects of typhoons can raise awareness and prepare us for future natural disasters. This can spur communities to implement stronger emergency response plans and improve overall disaster management infrastructure. Despite that, It is crucial to take notes about the negative effects that typhoons can have on living beings and their natural surroundings. It is important not to normalize or underestimate the damage caused by these natural disasters.
